I have terrible file organization skills 
but if all is correct you can run on localhost just by running app.py and pip installing all requirements.

Oh before that go to Google AI Studio. Generate an API token. Create an .env file on VS code if you are using and paste the token in a way I am showing below:

GOOGLE_API_KEY = "You Generated Key"  (PS as this is in a .env virtual environment file no need to put in apostophe commans just type normally)

After that you can run app.py hopefully ??

I dont know its just probably my boredom project hence not very refined or fancy (also I suckkk at UI)

Also I highly recommend watching some movies like : 
1. Brutalist is nice
2. 12 angry men is master class
3. shawshank redemption
4. Pianist
5. Kill Bill Vol 1 and Vol 2
6. Trials of Nuremberg
7. Silence of the Lambs
8. matrix
9. I did not understand the whole point of pulp fiction so I dont admire it at the same level as the world
10. Every Nolan film is too good (except the ones he made in film school I didnt watch it)

Follow me @imdb for my watchlist and stuff I am passionate movie director by heart than all coding shit

anyways Adios
