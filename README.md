I have terrible file organization skills 
but if all is correct you can run on localhost just by running app.py and pip installing all requirements.

I dont know its just probably my boredom project hence not very refined or fancy (also I suckkk at UI)

Also I highly recommend watching some movies like : 
1. Brutalist is nice
2. 12 angry men is master class
3. shawshank redemption
4. matrix
5. I did not understand the whole point of pulp fiction so I dont admire it at the same level as the world
6. Every Nolan film is too good (except the ones he made in film school I didnt watch it)

anyways Adios
